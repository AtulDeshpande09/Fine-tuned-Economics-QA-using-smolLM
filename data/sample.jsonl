{"instruction": "Distinguish between open unemployment and disguised unemployment.", "input": "", "output": "Open Unemployment – When a country’s labour force do not get opportunities fro adequate employment, this situation is called open unemployment. This type of unemployment is generally found in the industrial sector of our country. This is also found among the landless agricultural labourers in rural areas.\\nDisguised Unemployment – This is a kind of unemployment in which there are people who are visibly employed but actually they don’t have full employment. In such a situation more people are engaged in a work than required. This type of unemployment is generally found in unorganized sector where either work is not constantly available or too many people are employed for the same work that does not require so many hands."}
{"instruction": "Do you agree with the following statement. Give reasons in support of your answer?", "input": "Tertiary sector is not playing any significant role in the development of Indian economy.", "output": "The tertiary sector is not playing any significant role in the development of Indian economy is partially correct due to reasons as mentioned below :\\n\\nThe share of tertiary sector in employment has not increased in proportion to its increase in production. In 2000, the production in service sector rose by 11 times, whereas employment has risen less than three times. Therefore, still more than half of the workers in the country are working in the primary sector.\\n\\nNew services such as based on information technology have become important, but not all the services of the service sector are growing well. At one end are highly skilled and educated workers but on the other end, there are a very large number of workers engaged in services such as small shopkeepers, repair Arsons, transport persons. These persons barely manage to earn a living and yet they perform these services because no alternative opportunities for work are available to them. Such persons can not play any important role in the development of the Indian economy. It is this part of service sector that is not growing in importance."}
{"instruction": "Service sector in India employs two different kinds of people. Who are these?", "input": "", "output": "The service sector in India employs the following two different kinds of people. They are:\\n(a) The people involved in the services that may directly help in the production of goods. For example, people involved in the transportation, storage, communication, finance etc.\\n(b) The people involved in such services that may not directly help in the production of goods e.g. teachers, doctors, barbers, cobblers lawyers etc. They may be termed as ancillary workers means those who give services to the primary service providers."}
{"instruction": "Do you agree with this view.? Give reasons in support of your answer.", "input": "Workers are exploited in the unorganized sector.", "output": "Yes, workers are exploited in the unorganized sector. This would be clear from the following points:\\n\\nThere is no fixed number of working hours. The workers normally work 10 – 12 hours without paid overtime.\\nThey do not get other allowances apart fro the daily wages.\\nGovernment rules and regulations to protect the labourers are not followed there.\\nThere is no job security.\\nJobs are low paid the workers in this sector are generally illiterate, ignorant and unorganized. So they are not in a position to bargain or secure good wages.\\nBeing very poor they are always heavily in debt. So, they can be easily made to accept lower wages."}
{"instruction": "Compare the employment conditions prevailing in the organised and unorganised sectors.", "input": "", "output": "The employment conditions prevailing in the organised and unorganised sectors are vastly different. The organised sector has companies registered with the government and hence, it offers job security, paid holidays, pensions, health and other benefits, fixed working hours and extra pay for overtime work. On the other hand, the unorganised sector is a host of opposites. There is no job security, no paid holidays or pensions on retirement, no benefits of provident fund or health insurance, unfixed working hours and no guarantee of safe work environment"}
{"instruction": "Explain the objective of implementing the NREGA 2005.", "input": "", "output": "1.The objective of implementing the NREGA 2005 i.e., National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 is to implement the right to work.\\n 2.The Act has to be implemented in 200 districts.\\n 3.Under this Act, all those who are able to, and are in need of work have been guaranteed 100 days of employment in a year by the government.\\n 4.If the government fails in its duty to provide employment, it will give unemployment allowance to the people.\\n 5.The types of work that would in future help to increase the production from land will be given preference under this Act."}
{"instruction": "Explain how Public sector contributes to the economic development of a nation.", "input": "", "output": "In the following ways Public sector contributes to the economic development of a nation:\\n\\n1.It promotes rapid economic development through creation and expansion of infrastructure.\\n2.It creates employment opportunities.\\n3.It generates financial resources for development.\\n4.It is ensuring equality of income, wealth and thus, a balanced regional development.\\n5.It encourages development of small, medium and cottage industries.\\n6.It ensures easy availability of goods at moderate rates.\\n7.Contributes to community development i.e. to the Human Development Index (HDI) via health and educational services."}
{"instruction": "Explain with examples", "input": "The workers in the unorganised sector need protection on the following issues: wages, safety and health.", "output": "The workers in the unorganised sector need protection on the following issues: wages, safety and health. In the construction sector, labourers are employed on a daily basis. Hence, they have no job security. Here, wages too differ from time to time. Consequently, the government has set up a minimum wages act to protect such workers from economic exploitation.\\n\\nThe same problem exists for miners working in private mining companies. Their safety is secondary to the company’s profits, and as a result, many miners suffer grievous injuries (and many a times, even die) due to inadequate safety gear and norms. Governments of most nations have now laid down strict rules for private enterprises to ensure workers’ safety.\\n\\nMost companies in the unorganised sector do not provide health insurance to their employees. Some of these might be involved in dangerous factory production that may harm a worker’s health in the long term. These workers need to be protected against the tyranny of the employer, and it is here that the government steps in."}
{"instruction": "Explain", "input": "In situations with high risks, credit might create further problems for the borrower.", "output": "1.High-risk situations occur in rural areas because there the main demand for credit is for crop production which involves considerable costs on seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, water, electricity, repair of equipment.\\n2.There is a minimum stretch of three of four months between the time when farmers buy these inputs and when they sell the crop.\\n3.Farmers generally take crop loans at the beginning of the season and repay the loan after harvest.\\n4.Repayment of the loan is crucially dependent on the income from farming.\\n5.If a crop fails due to shortage of rain or for any other reason, a small farmer has to sell a part of the land to repay the loan.\\n6.Failure of crops create further problems for the borrowers. Credit does not improve his earnings but leaves him worse off than before. Credit in high risks situations pushes the borrower into a debt trap, a situation from which recovery is very painful."}
{"instruction": "Explain with example of your own.", "input": "How does money solve the problem of double coincidence of wants?", "output": "In a barter system where goods are directly exchanged without the use of money, double coincidence of wants is an essential feature. By serving as a medium of exchanges, money removes the need for double coincidence of wants and the difficulties associated with the barter system. For example, it is no longer necessary for the farmer to look for a book publisher who will buy his cereals at the same time sell him books. All he has to do is find a buyer for his cereals. If he has exchanged his cereals for money, he can purchase any goods or service which he needs. This is because money acts as a medium of exchange."}
